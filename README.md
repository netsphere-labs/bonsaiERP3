## *bonsaiERP 3*, renovation

<i>bonsaiERP 3</i> は, v2 までと互換性がありません。


### Frontend

 - Chart は <i>Chart.js</i> の v1.x 辺り。古すぎる。差し替える. Use `apexcharts`.
 - AngularJS v1.x 時代 (v1.0.0 = 2012年6月)。これも古すぎる. 作り直すしかない

Rails 8時代のフロントエンド

 - Hotwire (Turbo, Stimulus)  -- takes care of at least 80% of the interactivity
 
 - ▲ API mode + SPA アーキテクチャ (React)  -- 開発効率が悪すぎる
 
 - Inertia.js  -- APIレスのフロントエンド
   + <a href="https://techracho.bpsinc.jp/hachi8833/2025_10_20/153731">Rails: Inertia.jsでRailsのJavaScript開発にシンプルさを取り戻そう（翻訳)</a>
   + <a href="https://kinsta.com/jp/blog/inertia-js/">Inertia.jsの基本的な特徴や仕組み（徹底解説)</a> <blockquote><code>Link</code> がクリックされると、Inertiaがクリックイベントに介入し、XHRリクエストをサーバーに送信。サーバーはこれがInertiaのリクエストであることを認識して、JSONのレスポンスを返します。このレスポンスにはJavaScriptのコンポーネント名とデータが含まれており、その後、Inertiaは不要なコンポーネントを削除し、新しいページの訪問（表示）に必要なコンポーネントに置き換え、履歴の状態を更新</blockquote>

 - "react_on_rails" gem ("react-rails" の後継). コンポーネント単位で表示


TODO: Install a UI library.
 - <a href="https://github.com/ColorlibHQ/gentelella/">ColorlibHQ/gentelella: Free Bootstrap 5 Admin Dashboard Template</a> or
 - <a href="https://flowbite.com/">Flowbite - Build websites even faster with components on top of Tailwind CSS</a>

 - https://coreui.io/bootstrap/docs/forms/stepper/ PRO only
 - <a href="https://daisyui.com/">Tailwind CSS Component Library ⸺ daisyUI</a>



### Models

 - `accounts` table が取引を記録するようになっていたが, 設計がおかしい。v3 では, `accounts` table は勘定科目マスタ, `account_ledgers` table が仕訳を持つようにした。
 - `movement_details` table は `accounts` table にぶら下がっていた。上のとおり, `accounts` table は勘定科目マスタにして, `transactions` table を `orders` として復活させ、そこにぶら下げるようにした。`20140217134723_drop_transactions_table.rb` で drop しているのがおかしい。

●● おそらく, `stocks` table も時系列になっていないのでおかしい。




## Statechart of Inventory

    The diagrams are helpful, but there are many gaps.

## Installation

See <a href="INSTALL.md">INSTALL.md</a>


in development you will need to edit but in production you can configure
so you won't need to edit the `/etc/hosts` file for each new subdomain, start the app `rails s` and go to
http://app.localhost.bom:3000/sign_up to create a new account,
to capture the email with the registration code use [mailcatcher](http://mailcatcher.me/). Fill all registration fields
and then check the email that has been sent, open the url changing the port and you can finish creation of a new company.

> The system generates automatically the subdomain for your company name
> with the following function `name.to_s.downcase.gsub(/[^A-Za-z]/, '')[0...15]`
> this is why you should have the subdomain in `/etc/hosts`


### Attached files (UPLOADS)

*bonsaiERP* uses dragonfly gem to manage file uploads, you can set where
the files will go setting:

`config/initialiazers/dragonfly.rb`
